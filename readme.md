You only need run: docker-compose up --build

stack: fronted(react+antd+vite),backend(node-express+websocket)
tips:
1. first you will install the basic image, so take times; then u will build within 10s.
2. then vist localhost:80
3. username: qizi password: any(main user)
   username: nick password: any
   ... anyone u can input

4. If you want to chat, just open two tabs with same url localhost:80 (I only test in chrome, please use chrome, thanks), use other user login.
5. If you have any other question, feel free to contact me.
